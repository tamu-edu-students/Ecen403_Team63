- PCB from last semester is still intact and turns on. However, unable to download code (most likely fried some components last semester from running 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts through it. 
  - fixed PCB design (switches not shorted)
  - Bluetooth capabilities uploaded via Arduino (approval from sponsor/professor)

- Using Dev Kit until PCB comes in
  - pairing and conneciton with Android app achieved with app acting as the client and MCU as the server
  - PCB reviewed, removed R2, added mounting holes
  - Using Bluetooth Classic for connection, has unique MAC address

February 28, 2024
- PCB ordered and deliverd
- 65,535 successfully (but slowly) transferred to dev kit via Bluetooth
- soldered new board
- Capstone Blitz: powered new board, successfully uploaded Bluetooth Classic code and imported data points
