->This week I worked on implementing the basic UI for the app in Kotlin
    I sketched a preliminary design of the UI that will serve as a reference when designing the actual UI in Kotlin
    The appâ€™s UI will not contain any functionality but will provide a skeletal outline of how the app will look
->I have been researching how to program in Kotlin and use Android Studio
    I have been taking courses provided by Google to learn and understand how to program and make apps within Kotlin.
    I have several reference UI codes to assist me in the design of the AWG app.

Sept. 25, 2023:
->This week was dedicated to researching and improving upon my Kotlin coding skills
    I took more codelabs that taught programming basics and how to create my first Android app.
->I cleaned up the UI to be less blocky and cumbersome and discovered a few problems I need to fix such as the horizontal orientation not looking as expected
    Not much functionality progress was made in the app besides the UI tweaks

Oct. 02, 2023:
->This week I did further research into Kotlin and took more codelab practices
    Research focused on buttons, variables, state changes, and text fields.
->I implemented Text Fields into the app that allow users to type in any numeric value
    A bulk of my time was spent researching and learning about how to use and implement Text Fields as this is the main user interface with the application
->I added buttons titled "Mode" and "Settings" that have no functionality built-in yet.

Oct. 09, 2023:
->This week I replaced the mode button with an individual sine and square button
    This was a temporary change to allow me to test button functionality and when each button was pressed a new stock image would be displayed.
->Fixed earlier UI complications
    Added vertical scroll for when the app is in horizontal mode
    Fixed an issue where values stored in the text field would be deleted upon rotation

Oct. 16, 2023:
->This week I replaced the stock images with an actual graph that was able to display a sine wave based on user input
->I updated the mode and settings buttons to be dropdown menus with their own subitems
->For the mode button the text updates depending on the dropdown item selected
->I adjusted the input text fields to only allow valid inputs to be inserted, otherwise an error is displayed and the box turns red
->I added a settings button that will be used to export/import user data
